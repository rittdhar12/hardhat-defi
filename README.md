# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

1. Deposit Collateral: ETH/WETH âœ…
2. Borrow another asset: DAI 
3. Repay the DAI

// Mainnet Forking

Pros: Quick, easy, resemble whats on mainnet
Cons: We need an API, some contracts are complex to work with
